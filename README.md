![Start](1.jpg)

here we see first of all a photo of poor quality for which I apologize at work there is no time to take a good photo,
and now to the point:
a cable in green insulation which is required by the rules 1x2 blue and brown,
separately with it there are the same 2 wires but just 1.5 mm which are responsible for switching on the other side there is just a green cable in insulation
(We don't need a cable in the middle)
